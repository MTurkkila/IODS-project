# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you should use R Markdown syntax.*

The course seems to be set up nicely. At least much better than some online courses about statistics/programming. I hope I'll relearn to use R (briefly tried it about twelve years ago). RStudio seems convenient and I like the GitHub integration. Additionally, I hope to deepen my understanding of statistical methods.
